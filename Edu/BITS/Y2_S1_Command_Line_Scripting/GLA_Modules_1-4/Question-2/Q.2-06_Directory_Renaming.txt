6. Directory Renaming

Rename the documents directory to project_documents to reflect the project scope more clearly.

plan:
- cd to my home directory as the directory "documents" exists in my home directory
- rename documents directory as "graded_lab_assignment"

commands:
cd ~
mv documents graded_lab_assignment
