3. Content Addition

Write some sample text of your choice into the plan.txt file. The content can be a short project note or reminder.

command:
option-1: if it is just a one line or two lines description, I need to add to my existing file, I can echo <my new content> and redirect the output to a file using ">>" so that it only appends to the existing content of my file. I need to be careful NOT to use only ">" redirect command as this will overwrite the existing content of my file.

option-1 command:
echo "This is a short description of my plan to complete this project. I will add four directories in my github repository, naming them Question-[1 to 4] and add the relevant files to these directories and then submit the URL of the public repository"



option-2: open the file in an editor such as vi and add my content and save the file

use a editor such as vi, enter insert mode, add my new content to the file, save with w command, and quit the file

explanation: I can add new content to my file using either of these options. 
echo "my content" and redirect the standard out to append to my file
or
use a editor to add new content
