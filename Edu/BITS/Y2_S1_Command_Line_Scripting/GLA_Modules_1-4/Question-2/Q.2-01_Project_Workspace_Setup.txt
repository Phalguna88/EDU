1. Project Workspace Setup

Create a directory named documents inside your home directory. This directory will store your project-related files.


command: 
cd ~
mkdir documents

output: creates a directory, named documents, in my home directory

explanation:
cd ~ command takes me to my home directory, regardless of which directory I am currently in
(or cd command with no options also does the same) 


mkdir documents 
command creates a directory called documents (in the directory I am currently in; currently I am in my home directory)
