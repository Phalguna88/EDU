9. Recursive Listing

List all files and subdirectories inside project_documents recursively so that the complete directory structure is visible.

my project_documents directory is named "graded_lab_assignment"

commands:
cd ~
ls -lR graded-lab_assignment

explanation:
- I navigate to my home directory
- I use the command ls -lR, the long listing of ls command and the additional flag -R to recursively print all the subfiles and subdirectories of my named directory (in this case, my projects subdirectory named graded_lab_assignment)


output:
the output shows first the files and directories in my named directory (graded_lab_assignment) and then shows the files under each of the sub directories (in this case archive sub directory)
