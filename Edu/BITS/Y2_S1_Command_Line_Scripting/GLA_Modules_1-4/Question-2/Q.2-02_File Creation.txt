2. File Creation

Navigate into the documents directory and create a file named plan.txt.


command
cd documents
touch plan.txt

explanation:
cd documents takes me to the documents directory &
touch plan.txt command creates a new file (empty file).

touch <filename> command creates a new empty file if it does not exist and if it does exist, it updates it's access and modification times to the current time without changing contents.
