10. Path Verification

Display the absolute path of the plan_copy.txt file after it has been moved to the archive directory.

my project_documents directory is named "graded_lab_assignment"
the file plan_copy.txt is in the sub directory named "archive"

therefore, the absolute path should show this hierarchy structure 

command:
cd ~
find . -name "plan_copy.txt"

output:
./graded_lab_assignment/archive/plan_copy.txt

explanation:
I used the find command to search for a given file, the command searches for the file recursively through all the sub directories and once it finds the file, it prints the absolute path of the file
