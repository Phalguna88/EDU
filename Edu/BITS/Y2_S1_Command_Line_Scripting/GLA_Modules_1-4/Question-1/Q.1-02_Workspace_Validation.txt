Display the current working directory and list all files and directories in that location using long format listing.


(cd; pwd) && ls -l

Single command breakdown
No single command does both exactly, but this chained command displays current directory first, then long-format listing:

(cd; pwd): Prints working directory (pwd alone doesn't chain well).

&& ls -l: Then lists files/directories in long format (permissions, owner, size, date).

cd with no arguments defaults to $HOME (e.g., /home/username). Equivalent to cd ~ or cd $HOME.
