3. Environment Confirmation File

Create a file named user_info.txt and write the line:

&quot;Linux user environment verified&quot;


command:
touch user_info.txt &&
echo"\"Linux user environment verified\"" > user_info.txt

output: file "user_info.txt" created and the line with quotes "Linux user environment verified" is written to the file

explanation: 
first command:
touch command creates an empty file and 

then the next command:
echo "some words"  prints the matter enclosed in quotes to standard out (i.e. console)

In this case: echo"\"Linux user environment verified\"" 
Because I want to include the double quotes around my string, I used backslash in front of the quotes symbol, instructing the shell NOT to interpret the quotes and treat it as a literal, thereby printing the quotes too to the output

then the redirect command ">"
">" writes the previous command output (echo cmd output) to the argument that comes after ">" command, in this case, to the file user_info.txt
