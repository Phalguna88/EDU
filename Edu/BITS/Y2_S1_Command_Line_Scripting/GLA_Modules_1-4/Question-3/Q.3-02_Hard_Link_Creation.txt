2. Hard Link Creation

Create a hard link to sample_data.txt named sample_hard.txt.

command:
ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt

explanation:
In Linux, the coomand ln stands for Link. It creates either a hard link (default) or a symbolic link, also called soft link, if we use the option ln -s command. This facilitates multiple names to reference the same file.

in this case,
command: ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt
this creates a hard link sample_hard.txt that points to the same inode as the original file sample_data.txt


How do I check if it is the same file though the files are named differently?
I use the command ls -i option to show the inode numbers of both the files. If they both reference the same file, both files should show the same inode numbers

command: ls -li ./sample_data.txt ./sample_hard.txt

the output, ass seen in the corresponding screenshot, shows the same inode number for both files. In addition, the ls -l output shows the number of hard links, in this case the digit 2, for both files, as there are two filenames referencing the same entity.
