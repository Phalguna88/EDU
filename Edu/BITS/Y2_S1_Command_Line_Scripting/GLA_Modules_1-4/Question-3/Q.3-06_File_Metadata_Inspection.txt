6. File Metadata Inspection

Display detailed file information (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps) of sample_data.txt.

command: ls -l sample_data.txt

explanation:
the output shows one line per file with columns for 
- type/permissions [ -rw-r--r--],
  the very first - indicates that this is a regular file
                 - would be d if it is a directory
                 - would be l if it is a symbolic link
- hard link count [2 as there is a hard link to the same filename], 
- owner [coder], 
- group [coder], 
- size in bytes [225], 
- modification timestamp, and 
- name of the file
​
For directories, use ls -ld <directoryname> to view the directory's own details instead of its contents.
