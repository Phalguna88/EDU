8. File Size Overview

Display the size of each file present in your home directory in a human-readable format.

du -h --max-depth=1 ~ lists immediate subdirectories' usage plus total.
​
For top-level summary: du -sh --max-depth=0 ~.


command:
du -ah $HOME 

explanation: this command displays the size of each file and subdirectory in my home directory. the a option is used to show individual files, the h option to see the output in a human readable format

Since there are many directories and subdirectories in my home directory, I will use the option --max-depth=1 to limit the output to only the first level of files (& directories) in my homedir

output: shows the size of each file and directory in my homedir
the last line shows the size of my home directory, this case, 38 M (38 megabytes) of my home directory /home/coder  

Additional command:
If I want to see which are the largest files or directories occupying the most size, I can pipe the du command output to sort -r to get the output in descending order

command:
du -ah $HOME| sort -hr 

this cmd output shows huge space occupied by .cache and .mozilla folders
