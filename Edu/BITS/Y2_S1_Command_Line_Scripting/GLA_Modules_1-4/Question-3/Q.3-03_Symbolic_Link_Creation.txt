3. Symbolic Link Creation

Create a symbolic (soft) link to sample_data.txt named sample_soft.txt.

command: ln -s <source_filename> <target_filename> creates a symbolic link of the <source_filename> to a new filename <target_filename>

in this case:
command: ln -s sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt

explanation: ln -s (the s option) creates a symbolic link <sample_soft.txt> to the original source file <sample_data.txt>

how to check if the given filename is a link (hard / soft) or the original filename?

command: use the long listing format of ls command to see if a given filename is a symbolic link

ls -l sample_soft.txt shows that this filename is a symbolic link to sample_data.txt; the first letter l shows this is a symbolic link 

[ the hard link sample_hard.txt does not show the first letter l for this file, indicating that this is not a symbolic link  ]
