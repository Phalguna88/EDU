5. Inode Analysis

Identify which files share the same inode number and briefly explain the reason.


ls -li sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt

output & explanation:
For output, see the corresponding screenshot
As expected the two files sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt show the same inode number - 232577 - conforming that both these filenames are referencing one single entity.

Where as, the soft link file, shows a different inode number - 232454 - but the long format of ls command shows that file sample_soft.txt is a symbolic link to the source file sample_data.txt
