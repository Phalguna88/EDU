10. Disk Utility Demonstration

Demonstrate the usage of du and df commands using various useful options and briefly explain the output.

explanation:
the du command focuses primarily on DISK USAGE of files/directories - output in number of disk blocks, with a typical disk unit being 4096 bytes or 4 kilobytes

the df command focuses primaruly on DISK USAGE of filesystems


du Examples
du -h /home: Shows subdirectory sizes in Kilobytes or Megabytres, summing allocated blocks recursively.
​

du -sh /home: Displays total size only (e.g., 17 megabytes in my case), 
    the option -s summarizes and ignores sub directories
​
du -h --max-depth=1 /home : Limits to one level (e.g., 9M for my homedir and 7.8M for developer user home in my case), useful for top-level overview.

du -h --max-depth=1 $HOME [ for my own directory, this command would list the top diles or directories occupying the most size (size sorted in descending order)
​


df Examples
df -h: Lists filesystems with columns for 
name of the filesystem,
size, 
used, 
available, 
usage%, and 
mountpoint (e.g., / in my case ), reporting free space accurately.

​

df -hT /: Adds T - type column with specific mount points (e.g., zfs in my case )
​

df -i: Shows inode usage - Inodes count, Inodes Used, Inodes Free,  IUse% for inode fullness for file-count issues.
